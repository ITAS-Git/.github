## Purpose

The primary purpose of this GitHub organization is to:

1. **Facilitate Collaboration**: Encourage students to engage in group projects and work collaboratively.
2. **Version Control**: Utilize GitHub for managing version control of projects and assignments.
3. **Skill Development**: Help students develop practical skills in using version control systems and collaborative coding.
4. **Feedback & Evaluation**: Allow instructors to provide feedback and assess student assignments directly on GitHub.

## Organization Structure

The ITAS GitHub Organization contains multiple repositories classified generally into two main categories:

- **Student Assignments**: Repositories related to individual or smaller project assignments.
- **Group Projects**: Repositories dedicated to group work, including larger capstone projects.

## Repositories

### Student Assignments
These repositories are usually named following the pattern `assignment-coursecode-assignmentnumber`, for example, `assignment-CS101-01`.

### Group Projects
Group project repositories often adhere to a naming convention like `project-groupname-coursename`, such as `project-teamalpha-SD102`.

## Getting Started

### For Students:

1. **Create a GitHub Account**: Make sure you have a GitHub account and are added to the ITAS organization.
2. **Clone Repository**: Clone the relevant repository to your local machine using:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ITAS-org/repository-name.git
    ```
3. **Commit Changes**: Work on your assignments/projects, and commit changes regularly.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "describe your changes"
    git push origin branch-name
    ```

### For Instructors:

1. **Create Repository**: Set up repositories for assignments or projects and assign access permissions.
2. **Review Work**: Monitor contributions and provide feedback or grades using GitHub's review tools.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Branching Strategy

- **Main Branch (Master)**: Reserved for final and stable code.
- **Development Branch**: Used for developing new features and major changes.
- **Feature/Assignment Branches**: Work should be done on branches named after the feature or assignment, e.g., `feature-login`, `assignment-01`.

### Pull Requests

1. Ensure the code compiles and runs correctly.
2. Make sure to write clear commit messages.
3. Open a pull request against the `development` branch.
4. Await review and approval from instructors or team leads.

### Commit Message Guidelines

- Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Include the purpose and what changes have been made.

## Code of Conduct

All participants are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which establishes guidelines for respectful and productive collaboration.

## Support
